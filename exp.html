<p align=justify>As a student majoring in Library Management, I need to undergo practical training in order to be prepared 
for the future as a librarian. At first I felt very scared because I had no work experience. Undergoing industrial training 
at PPAP, Kuantan is considered my work experience. My view of PPAP is that they have a large library as well as an 
interesting build. Because I underwent practical training for only 6 weeks, I was placed in one department every week. 
The experience I gained from undergoing this practical training was that I could see clearly about everyone in the library. 
Apart from that, I also gained knowledge on how to organize books according to its own provisions. In PPAP there are many 
interesting book collections, especially a very limited collection of books such as One Piece. Furthermore, I also gained 
experience on how to communicate with patrons regardless of age or religion. After the end of the practical training period 
at PPAP, I felt very sad because it was very difficult to meet good employees and even treat me like family. I hope in the 
future I will be given another opportunity like this to gain more experience in the field of libraries.</p>
