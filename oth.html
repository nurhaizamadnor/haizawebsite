law field, members who will be able to contribute meaningfully. Professor Kim Eun-Sook (Lee Jung-eun) is his only colleague

She comes from a poor family background, being raised by a single mother. At school, she is surrounded by students who are 
smart and come from wealthy backgrounds. She feels insecure and even shameful due to her background. Kang Sol slowly learns about 
the true legal profession. Han Joon-Hwi is at the top among first year law school students. He is an attractive young man with leadership qualities.

<p><font color="black">At the age of eight, Park Joo-Hyung (Song Joong-ki) went to Italy after being adopted by an Italian family. He later 
joins the mafia, where he is subsequently adopted by Don Fabio, head of the Cassano mafia family. Park Joo-Hyung was 
renamed Vincenzo Cassano and became an Italian lawyer, a consigliere for the mafia, and Don Fabio's right-hand man. 
After Fabio dies, Paolo, Fabio's biological son and the new leader of the Cassano Family attempts to kill Vincenzo. 
Vincenzo kills the assassins that Paolo sent and flees to Seoul and sets out to recover 1.5 tons of gold that he helped a 
Chinese tycoon who recently died secretly stash within the basement of Geumga Plaza. However, a real estate company under 
Babel Group has illegally taken ownership of the building, and Vincenzo must use his skills to reclaim the building and 
recover his fortunes. Vincenzo then becomes involved with lawyer Hong Cha-young (Jeon Yeo-been), the type of attorney who 
will do anything to win a case but found her way back when her father was killed under the orders of a corrupt lawyer which 
is under the payroll of Babel Group. As Vincenzo Cassano (Song Joong-ki) works with Hong Cha-young (Jeon Yeo-been), he 
founds that he has bonded with the various tenants within the Geumga Plaza despite being ostracized by them in the 
beginning as the tenants give Vincenzo and Cha-young their assistance as they try to take down Babel Group.</font></p>

<p><font color="black">Hyuk is hospitalized with Hepatitis B. While the other patients as well as his own parents keep their distance, nurse 
Da-eun (Chae Soo-bin) ignores them and willingly takes care of him. As time goes by Hyuk and Da-eun grow closer, the 
overworked Da-eun even eating and resting with Hyuk on his hospital bed at times. A few days before Hyuk would be 
discharged from the hospital Da-eun appears to be distant. The downcast Hyuk returns home. But, being unable to forget 
Da-eun, he manages to find out her phone number and gives her a call. She eventually invites him to come over to her house, 
and he stays the night. In the morning Da-eun wakes up to find that Hyuk has replaced the broken lamp in her hallway, as 
well as having prepared breakfast for the two of them. Touched by the gestures they share a brief kiss. After a while 
Da-eun tells Hyuk that she won tickets to Jeju island for Christmas and she invites him to join her. Da-eun buys them 
matching shoes, which he happily accepts, hell-bent on losing weight.In the next scene we see a slim Hyuk (Jang Ki-yong) 
running in the park wearing the same sneakers. A hard working engineer, he is soon told by his superior that he will be 
dispatched to a big company in Seoul. This means that there will be a long commute from Incheon to Seoul and that if he 
does well he might be granted a permanent position at the firm. However, on his first day he finds out there is another 
candidate, this means that he would not be guaranteed a permanent position at the end of his contract. The other candidate, 
Bo-yeong (Krystal Jung), turns out to be very competitive, regularly undermining him to make herself look better in the 
eyes of their superior. At a board meeting where the team presents a new bridge design based on a proposal by Bo-yeong, 
Hyuk points out that there is a critical flaw in the design that would lead to a collapse if the bridge would ever be hit 
by a tsunami. A humiliated Bo-yeong is told to fix the problem together with Hyuk. While Hyuk leaves early she works 
throughout the night without taking a rest. At the start, Hyuk takes pleasure in seeing her suffer, but he eventually 
takes pity on her and they end up working together to fix the problem. The two start bonding and they continue working on 
more projects together. Meanwhile, some strain is showing on the relationship of Hyuk and Da-eun, with both of them 
regularly working late and Hyuk becoming increasingly frustrated at having to commute between Incheon and Seoul. He usually 
comes home tired and shows little interest in Da-eun. One night when he comes home Da-eun complains about him not having 
fixed the broken light bulb and his refusal to take out the trash. When they start arguing she tells him that she hasn't 
had her period, and it turns out that she is expecting his child, which she aborts later on. Rather than being pleased, it 
seemed to frustrate Hyuk even more. As he realizes he has feelings for Bo-yeong. He starts to distance himself from 
Bo-yeong, and starts to focus on Da-eun. But eventually, this starts to impact his work. One night Bo-yeong confronts 
him and tells him that at this rate both of their performance will suffer. Hyuk agrees to work late and he starts doing 
overtime again, leaving Da-eun alone at home. One evening, Da-eun and Hyuk were seen going out together. Hyuk shows no 
interest in spending time with Da-eun and continuously complains about the crowd and repeatedly says that he wants to eat 
and go home. Back in the car Da-eun complains that Hyuk never wants to spend time with her anymore. Hyuk brushes it off 
and accidentally calls her his "pretty Bo-yeong". They get into a big argument, in which he denies Da-eun's claims that 
he's cheating on her. He eventually drops her off at their once shared house as he drives off in fury. Back in Seoul 
Bo-yeong and Hyuk are once again working overtime. With all their time spent together and the gradually growing sexual 
tension between both of them, Hyuk kisses Bo-yeong. Both of them eventually get romantically involved. After a while, 
Hyuk becomes restless and appears to be longing for Da-eun again. When neither Bo-yeong or himself is offered a 
permanent position by the firm, Hyuk tells Bo-yeong at the firm's team dinner that he will return to his previous 
position in Incheon. She in turn tells him that she will study abroad as her old job is also not a permanent contract. 
In the background the team manager announces that they can win a free Christmas trip to Jeju. Hyuk hearing this thinks of 
the Jeju trip he was supposed to go on with Da-eun that Christmas. Coincidentally, their flight was meant to be that very 
evening. Realizing he still loves Da-eun, he rushes to the airport in a taxi. As he pulls up at the airport, he sees Da-eun 
standing on the sidewalk in front of the airport building. Jumping out of the taxi, he sees her supposedly waving at him. 
He runs towards her but he bumps into someone and falls over. The man he ran into turned out to be the Hyuk shown in the 
first part of the film. The scene is the same one from earlier when Da-eun gave the matching pair of sneakers. It is 
revealed that the Hyuk from the start of the film is a different Hyuk than the one from the main part of the film. 
Both storylines happened simultaneously, and as it turns out Da-eun bonded with Hyuk while she felt neglected by her 
partner Jang-Hyuk, and because he did all the things Jang-Hyuk didn't do, such as fixing the light bulb. Both of them 
leave on the trip for Jeju while Jang-Hyuk returns to the party in shock. Bo-yeong later reveals to him that she had 
just won the Christmas trip to Jeju and that they could go together.</font></p>
