<p><font color="black">I started school here since I was in kindergarten again, starting at the age of 6 years. 
After finishing kindergarten, my mother decided to keep me in this school until 6th grade. While at this school, 
I had many good friends among them were Waa, Dirah, Emy and Mimi. When I was in elementary school, I was a school 
athlete as well as a school netball player. When I was in grade 5, I was appointed by the SPBT teacher to be the 
textbook supervisor. Then at the end of the year of being at the school, I was appointed superintendent. I came out 
of this school with quite satisfactory exam results namely 4A and 1B.</font></p>

<p><font color="black">When I was 13 to 18 years old, I was educated at SMK Seri Pekan. Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri 
Pekan or its short name is SMK Seri Pekan, is a national secondary school located in Bandar Baru Peramu. The original 
concept of the establishment of SISP was to realize the wishes of the then Minister of Education, YB Dato 'Seri Mohd Najib 
bin Tun Abdul Razak during a meeting with the Pahang Director of Education on 24 November 1996. The two pilot schools 
selected were SMK Seri Pekan and SM Clifford, Kuala Lipis. When I was in form one, I was admitted to a special stream 
class, the religion class. In 2015, I took PT3 and managed to get 8A 2B. Armed with that decision, I had taken art stream 
classes while in Form 5. Throughout my time at this school, I was not some active in any division whatsoever as there was 
a lot of competition. I graduated from high school in 2018 with SPM results that qualified me to continue my studies to the 
next level.</font></p>

<p><font color="black">I have continued my studies at UiTM Kedah majoring in Library Management. This course has 4 
semesters where 1 semester must be completed for 6 months and the subjects in this course for each semester there are 8 
or 9 subjects. While in semester 1, I had gone to college and studied physically. I have met many new friends who come from 
various states. During the beginning of semester two which is in early 2019, Covid 19 was hit and students were required to 
undergo virtual learning. It continues until the next semester. Now I am in the last semester which is semester 4. For me, 
this virtual learning has more adverse effects especially the mental health of a student. Even so with the support from 
people around, my journey in the diploma level has almost come to an end where I will end in the year 2021. During my stay 
at UiTM Kedah, friends who are teachers have helped me a lot in terms of learning. I hope I will be able to finish my 
studies in diploma level on time.</font></p>
